Linear Regression ML

A sample project using Numpy with Gradient Decent to solve logarithms based on a dataset

## How to use

Run Main.py file with python. ex. `~$ python Main.py`  Dataset is located in Data.csv file.


## Hyper Parameters 

Hyper Parameters are in line 9-10.  The Learning Rate defines how big the change is in each training step. The Number of Training Steps decides how many times the model is to be trained.  The Starting M value is what the algorithm starts with during the first training.

```python
#Hyper Parameters
learningRate = 0.0001 <- The Learning Rate
trainingSteps = 1000 <- Number of training steps
startingM = 1 <- Starting M value
```
